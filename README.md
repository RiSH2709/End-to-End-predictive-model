# 🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains an **end-to-end machine learning model** designed to predict real estate prices. The model is simple yet effective, built using Python and leverages a few key libraries to process data, train a model, and provide predictions through an easy-to-use interface.

## Project Structure
- **`Real_Estate.csv`**: The dataset used for model training and evaluation. It includes features like distance from the station, proximity to convenience stores, latitude, and longitude, which are crucial for predicting property prices.
  
- **`Realestate.ipynb`**: The Python script that:
  - Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
  - Trains a linear regression model.
  - Deploys a simple Dash app where users can input key features to get real-time price predictions.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**:
  - 📂 Utilizes the `pandas` library for loading and preprocessing the real estate dataset.
  - 🔍 Handles missing data and optimizes the dataset for model training.

- **Model Development**:
  - 🤖 Implements a **linear regression model** for predicting real estate prices based on the input features.
  - 🧠 The model is trained and evaluated within the script, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.

- **User Interface**:
  - 🖥️ **Dash-based interface** where users can input:
    - Distance from the station
    - Convenience store proximity
    - Latitude and Longitude
  - 🎯 Just click **“Predict”** to get an instant estimate of the property price.

## Requirements
To run this project on your local machine, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `dash`, `sklearn`

You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git
    cd real-estate-price-prediction
    ```
2. **Place the `realestate.csv` file** in the same directory as the `realestate.py` script.
3. **Run the Python script**:
    ```bash
    python realestate.py
    ```
4. **Open the Dash app** in your browser, input the required features, and click “Predict” to see the results.

## What’s Not Included
- **Advanced Model Tuning**: This project uses a basic linear regression model. Advanced users might want to experiment with more complex models or hyperparameter tuning.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: The provided `realestate.csv` is a sample dataset. For more accurate predictions, you might need a more comprehensive dataset with additional features.
